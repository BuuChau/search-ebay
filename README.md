Filtering results with item filters.
You can control your results by specifying item filters (itemFilter) for a variety of properties, including the item condition, number of bids, price range, listing type, and more.

Refining results with aspect filters.
Aspect filters (aspectFilter) let you use standard item characteristics, such as Style or Color, to refine your search results.

Including additional data in the response. 
Specify one or more outputSelector fields to retrieve more than the default set of response data. For example, you can retrieve seller information for each item, or an aspect histogram.

Sorting results.
Use sortOrder to specify the order in which returned items are sorted, such as by price or by listing end time.

Paginating the results. 
Use paginationInput to divide the items matching the search criteria into subsets, or "pages," of data.
